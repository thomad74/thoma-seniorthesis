This repository contains the implementation of my code for my senior project. It will contain the algorithm for calculating the most effecient cluster based on performance and time efficiency while running a MapReduce job.

Code can be found in the src directory of this repository. The documentation directory contains two PDFs of preliminary work that had to be completed to manually understand the setup of the nodes and clusters as well as the running of the MapReduce job, before the algorithm was created to automate the process. This documenation was referenced in the writing briefly.
